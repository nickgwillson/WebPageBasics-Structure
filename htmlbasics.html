<h1>
Basic HTML Animals
</h1>

<p>
This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.
</p>

<h2>
The Llama
</h2>

<p>
Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
</p>

<h2>
The Anaconda
</h2>

<p>
The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.

<h1>Emphasis and importance</h1>

      <p>There are two things I care about — <strong>music</strong> and <strong>friends</strong>. Someday I might be able to get my friends interested in each other, <em>and</em> my <strong>music</strong>!</p>
